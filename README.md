# n-Queens Solver

This program attempts to sovle the n-queens problem with a variety of techniques. It includes hill-climb, stochastic hill-climb, pruned and unpruned BFS and simulated annealing.

Warning: BFS is unlikely to be able to solve for many values of N due to the memory limitations of a BFS search.
